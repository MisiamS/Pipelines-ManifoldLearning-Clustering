# Pipelines-ManifoldLearning-Clustering
An end-to-end exploration of unsupervised machine learning using scikit-learn pipelines for data preparation, combined with manifold learning techniques (t-SNE, MDS) with clustering algorithms (DBSCAN) for dimensionality reduction, visualization and pattern discovery

## Objectives
- Explore and visualize high-dimensional data using manifold learning
- Apply clustering to uncover meaningful groups
- Build clean, modular workflows using pipelines
- Evaluate clustering structure post dimensionality reduction

## Techniques Used
- Data Preprocessing
- Dimensionality Reduction (t-SNE, MDS)
- Clustering (KMeans, DBSCAN)

### Pipelines
- Constructed clean pipelines 
  - Preprocessing → Dimensionality Reduction → Clustering
  - Flexibility and reuse with different method combinations

## Results
- Visualized cluster separability using 2D projections from t-SNE and MDS
- Compared clustering performance (DBSCAN vs. KMeans)
- Identified noise/outliers and high-density regions using DBSCAN
- Used clustering results to segment customer behavior and inform marketing strategies
- Demonstrated the value of unsupervised learning for practical business decision-making
